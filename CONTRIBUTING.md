# Contribution guide

## Developing Ethereum NFT Sales Bot

Please consider these guidelines when filing a pull request:

-   Commits follow the [Angular commit convention](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines)
-   4 spaces indentation
-   Features and bug fixes should be covered by test cases

## Creating releases

we uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
to release new versions automatically.

-   Commits of type `fix` will trigger bugfix releases, think `0.0.1`
-   Commits of type `feat` will trigger feature releases, think `0.1.0`
-   Commits with `BREAKING CHANGE` in body or footer will trigger breaking releases, think `1.0.0`

All other commit types will trigger no new release.

## Creating pull requests

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
